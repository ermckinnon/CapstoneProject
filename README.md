## Folders
This repository consists of folders with all of the file to:

- Develop ngram tables: import corpus data and translate to ngram prediction tables  
- Prediction script: to run a variety of prediction functions and different models
- Model testing: to test the different models on a test set 
- Next Text app files: a Shiny application to showcase the final model

An additional milestone report folder contains exploratory analysis of the training corpus.
